  <summary><em>Data preparation</em></summary>
  Using the reference materials, you can find a link to the dataset. You can preprocess dataset in roboflow. As you know YOLOv5 Ðµakes image size 416x416, so I     resized it to this size. To use the dataset you need to click as in the following photos:

  <summary><em>Train and test the model</em></summary>
  To see how to define model configuration and architecture, train and detect model you need to clone my repo and open file "Train_Yolov5.ipynb".
  In folder weights I saved my post-train weights. You can use them or save your.

  <summary><em>Real-time webcam detection</em></summary>
  To see how to define model configuration and architecture, train and detect model you need to clone my repo and open file Real_time_webcam_Yolov5.ipynb.
  This notebook is using file webcamdetect.py where you may find necessary functions.
